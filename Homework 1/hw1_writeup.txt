Homework 1 Part 2
1.
a) See part 1
b) "   "    "
c) "   "    "

d)
	Π hour, trips/100 (σ x (hourly_ridership))
		where x = (((hour > 7) ^ (hour < 10)) ∨ hour = 7) ∨ (((hour > 17) ^ (hour < 19)) ∨ hour = 17)  

e)
	Π x (σ y (occupancy ⋈z weather))
		x = occupancy.station, occupancy.datetime, condition, riders
		y = condition = 'sunny' ∨ condition = 'rainy'
		z = occupancy.station = weather.station ^ occupancy.datetime = weather.datetime\

a)
	CREATE TABLE scooter
	(
		scooter_id 			serial,
		flag				integer				NOT NULL,
		home				varchar(30)			NOT NULL,
		location			point,
		PRIMARY KEY(scooter_id)
	);

	CREATE TABLE user
	(
		user_id				serial,
		credit_card			integer,
		exp_date			timestamp,
		email				varchar(30)			NOT NULL,
		PRIMARY KEY(user_id)
	);

b)
	CREATE TABLE trip
	(
		trip_id			serial,
		user_id			serial,
		scooter_id		serial,
		start_pos		point					NOT NULL,
		end_pos			point					NOT NULL,
		start_time		timestamp				NOT NULL,
		end_time		timestamp				NOT NULL,
		PRIMARY KEY(trip_id),
		FOREIGN KEY(scooter_id) REFERENCES scooter(scooter_id),
		FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES user(user_id)
	);

c)
	Method 1: insert row to database and modify row in database
		Pros
		-no loss of data - reliable
		Cons
		-frequently accessing database - slower operations
		-increases database traffic 
		-increases user's cell phone data usage

	Method 2: cache ride data locally and then insert row in database
		Pros
		-reduces database traffic
		-saves resources needed to push new data to database
		-faster operations because part of inserting a new entry is done locally
		Cons
		-possible loss of data if user's cell phone loses power during ride

	-would prefer method 2 as there are more pros, and the cons are rare cases
	Method 3: cache ride data on scooter and insert row in database
		Pros
		-same as all pros in both of above methods
		-don't have to worry about it losing power during a ride, as it already stops users from riding it when on low battery
		Cons
		-more costly to implement an embedded system in all scooter units
